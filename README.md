# To-Do List (Desktop GUI) v1
A very simple python to-do list that can be launched from your computer menu! <br>
To operate the program, download `main.exe` from the Latest Release. <br>
## Configurations
To make changes to the source files simply open the Latest Release and download the source files as `tar.gz` or `zip`. Enjoy! <br>
## Warning!
Please note that the functionality of this software is very minimal: it only manages creation, removal, editing and display of list elements from a text file (`user_data.txt`). Due to this, the software's security is subject to your computer's security settings.
