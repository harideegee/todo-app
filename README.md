# Todo List (CLI)
A very simple python to do list that works on command line. <br>
Simply clone this repo to your workspace and run the `app.py` file. Enjoy! <br>
Please note that the functionality of this software is very minimal: it only manages creation, removal, editing and display of list elements from a text file (`user_data.txt`)
